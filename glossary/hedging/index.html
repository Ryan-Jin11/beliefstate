  <h1>Hedging</h1>

  <div class="def">
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Hedging is the use of qualifying language to manage uncertainty when a belief has not fully stabilized. In both formal belief theory and AI-generated answers, hedging functions to reduce exposure to unknowns by softening claims, signaling ambiguity, or acknowledging variability in evidence or outcomes.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What this is</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A linguistic expression of uncertainty management.</li>
    <li>A visible signal that confidence is conditional rather than absolute.</li>
    <li>An outcome of incomplete consensus, missing constraints, or unresolved tradeoffs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What this is not</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Not an error or failure by the AI.</li>
    <li>Not unique to AI systems.</li>
    <li>Not a replacement for evidence or explanation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example signals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High hedging:</strong> ‘may,’ ‘can,’ ‘often,’ ‘depends,’ ‘varies by context.’</li>
    <li><strong>Low hedging:</strong> confident assertions paired with clearly stated boundaries, assumptions, and exceptions.</li>
  </ul>
